              <p>
                <strong>4.1 AI Processing:</strong> InBoxt uses third-party AI services (OpenRouter API) to analyze and summarize 
                your emails. Email content is processed transiently and not stored by the AI provider beyond processing.

                <strong>4.4 AI Limitations:</strong> While our AI strives for accuracy, automated summaries may occasionally miss
